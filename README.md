ChangeFolderName
================

I've done this program to rename a lot of folder/files for mim using some sequence patterns.
I have files inside folders like "sometext(720p)x264" and i want to rename that to have only "sometext".
If anyone want to use this code:
- Change the isValidName function to specify the files pattern
- Change calcToRemove function to specify how to deal with the patterns
- Change the Path to the main folder that you want to run
